# Introduction
Welcome to the ECEN 403/404 TEM Capstone Project repository! This repository contains the code and resources for our project. Tranmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) takes an electron
charged sample, positively charged probe, and acceleration voltage to capture images of the patterns. These images are then used to analyze and interpret interactions at the molecular
level. Samsung Austin Semiconductor (SAS) needs a better method of determining TEM sample thickness since it is important for quantitative interpretation of energy dispersive X-ray
spectrometry (EDX) and geographic phase analysis (GPA) to obtain the accurate and reliable composition measurement and strain profile.

<br />

The project aims to create an analytical database with a working graphical user interface (GUI) using the position averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED) technique.
This technique is a precise and convenient TEM thickness determination technique in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Overall, this is essential for technology node sample
preparation and imaging processes as it is more accurate and ensures mechanical stability during wafer manufacturing and device processing.

# Installation

### Database Installation:

**FILL THIS OUT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**


<br />

### GUI Installation:

This allows you to use Tkinter:

    pip install tk

<br />

This allows you to use OpenCV which is a Python library that allows you to process images:

    pip install opencv-python

<br />

This allows you to use Pillow, which is another image processing library, and Pandas, which allows for the Table View
by using pandastable:

    pip install pillow pandas pandastable
